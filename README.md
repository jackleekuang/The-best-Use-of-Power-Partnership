<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Overview

This collaborative project, conducted with [Jeco Cheung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jecocheung/) & [Weber Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weber-tsungwei-lin/) as part of the DSO 574 course at the University of Southern California, This project explores the most effective strategies for leveraging partnerships between star players, such as Stephen Curry X Klay Tompson, Luka Dončić X Kyrie Irving, or Lebron X Anthony Davis, to maximize their performance and win games. Additionally, we investigate whether these partnerships provide extra benefits that enhance the performance of their teammates. To address these questions, we analyze the 2019-2020 Los Angeles Lakers, focusing specifically on the dynamic between LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
